            <h2 class="ascii fancy rainbow">Linear Algebra</h2>
            <p>You probably already know a little linear algebra! You may have seen this type of puzzle online before:</p>
            <div class="fruit-math">
                <span><img src="apple.png" alt="Apple"> + <img src="apple.png" alt="Apple"> + <img src="apple.png" alt="Apple"> = 30</span>
                <span><img src="apple.png" alt="Apple"> + <img src="banana.png" alt="Banana"> + <img src="banana.png" alt="Banana"> = 18</span>
                <span><img src="banana.png" alt="Banana"> - <img src="orange.png" alt="Orange"> = 2</span><br>
                <span><img src="apple.png" alt="Apple"> = ?<img src="banana.png" alt="Banana"> = ?<img src="orange.png" alt="Orange"> = ?</span>
            </div>
            <p>Believe it or not, finding what apple, banana, and orange are is linear algebra!</p>
            <p>I won't be focusing much on solving these types of puzzles, since they don't really deal too much directly to 3D rendering, but I like to tell people they know linear algebra despite not realizing it!</p>

            <h3>Vectors</h3>
            <p>A vector is an abstract concept in math that can be defined in a few different ways, but for our purposes, a vector is an ordered list of numbers.</p>
            <p>For simplicity, I'll start with a 2D vector. They take they form $$\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}$$ and point \( x \) units in the \( x \) direction and \(y \) units in the \( y \) direction.</p>
            <p>For example, this is what the vector \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} \) looks like:</p>
            <img src="vector.png" alt="An arrow on a grid pointing diagonally upwards, more up then right.">
            <p>Notice that if you start from the start of the arrow, the tail, and go to the tip, the head, you travel 1 unit in the \( x \) and 2 in the \( y \).</p>
            <p>Some important vectors are called unit vectors. The 2D unit vectors are $$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, ~ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$</p>
            <img src="unitvector.png" alt="Unit vectors [1, 0], [0, 1] on a grid.">
            <p>Vectors alone can do ... not that much and that is where matrices come in!</p>

            <h3>Matrices</h3>
            <p>A matrix can also be defined in a few ways, but for now, it is best to introduce what they do rather than what they are.</p>
            <p>Matrices can transform vectors; matrices can rotate, mirror, translate, and do a lot more to vectors!</p>
            <p>I personally like to define matrices as "instructions", of sorts, telling us where the unit vectors go. By transforming the unit vectors, all the other vectors get transformed too.</p>
            <p>For example, if you have a vector \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} \), and want to scale it by 2, we can scale the unit vectors by 2, and so we take each unit vector, 
                $$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, ~ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
                scale them by 2,
                $$\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, ~ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$$
                then combine them into a matrix
                $$\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$$
            </p>
            <p>Any vector transformed by that matrix, will also get scaled by 2.</p>
            <p>Matrix transformation is done by matrix multiplication: $$\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$$</p>

            <p>Another example, if you want \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} \) to be rotated by 30 degrees, we need to find there the unit vectors go.</p>
            <p>The first unit vector, 
                $$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} $$
                is pretty easy to find where it goes. This is just exactly the same trigonometry from before! Because this is a distance 1 from the center of some circle and already laying in the flat direction needed, rotating it by 30 degrees is just 
                $$ \begin{bmatrix} \cos(30^{\circ}) \\ \sin(30^{\circ}) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.866 \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}$$
            </p>
            <p>The second unit vector,
                $$ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$
                isn't too much harder to find out. We can imagine that it was on the flat direction needed, but then rotated 90 degrees + 30 degrees, and so
                $$ \begin{bmatrix} \cos(90^{\circ} + 30^{\circ}) \\ \sin(90^{\circ} + 30^{\circ}) \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} \cos(120^{\circ}) \\ \sin(120^{\circ}) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -0.5 \\ 0.866 \end{bmatrix}$$
            </p>
            <p>So, to rotate any vector by 30 degrees, use this matrix
                $$\begin{bmatrix} 0.866 & -0.5 \\ 0.5 & 0.866 \end{bmatrix}$$
            </p>
            <p>You may notice that 
                $$ \cos(90^{\circ} + 30^{\circ}) = -0.5$$ 
                and that
                $$ -\sin(30^{\circ}) = -0.5$$ 
                which isn't a coincidence!
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, you may notice that
                $$ \sin(90^{\circ} + 30^{\circ}) = 0.866$$ 
                and that
                $$ \cos(30^{\circ}) = 0.866$$ 
                which still isn't a coincidence!
            </p>
            <p>It shouldn't be too hard to see that, to rotate any vector by any angle \( \theta \), just use this matrix
                $$\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\ \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix}$$
            </p>

            <h3>Higher Dimensions</h3>
            <p>The idea of using the unit vectors to make a transformation matrix, applies to higher dimensions as well! You'll need as many unit vectors for as many dimensions you have. For example, in 3D, there are 3 unit vectors
                $$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, ~ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, ~ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
                which form larger transformation matrices.
            </p>
