            <h2 class="ascii fancy rainbow">Trigonometry</h2>
            <p>Trigonometry (trig) is the math dealing with triangles, but as you'll soon see, it relates really closely to rotations.</p>
            <p>There are two basic trig functions, \( \text{sine} \) and \( \text{cosine} \).</p>
            <p>You may be familiar with functions like $$f(x) = 3 \cdot x+1$$ or they may be written as $$y=3\cdot x+1$$</p>
            <p>These both represent the same thing, a simple line. \( f(x) \) represents being able to "plug" in a value of \( x \) into \( 3\cdot x + 1\). For example, $$f(6) = 3\cdot 6 + 1 = 17$$</p>
            <p>These can be written into a table so we can easily see what different values \( f(x) \) can be:</p>
            <table class="function">
                <tr>
                    <th>\( x \)</th>
                    <th>\(f(x) = 3\cdot x+1\)</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>\(0\)</td>
                    <td>\(3\cdot 0+1=1\)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>\(1\)</td>
                    <td>\(3\cdot 1+1=4\)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>\(2\)</td>
                    <td>\(3\cdot 2+1=7\)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>\(3\)</td>
                    <td>\(3\cdot 3+1=10\)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Now, \( \text{sine} \) and \( \text{cosine} \) are also just some functions, except a little more complicated. Instead of doing some simple arithmetic on some number, \( \text{sine} \) and \( \text{cosine} \) take an angle as an input, and output a ratio between two sides of a triangle. Let's look at \( \text {sine} \) first.</p>

            <h3>Sine</h3>
            <p>\( \text{sine} \) (often abbreviated as \( \sin \)) takes an angle as an input. This angle is typically given this symbol: \( \theta \) called theta.</p>
            <p>It is probably easiest to view an example of what \( \sin \) outputs. Let's say we input \( 30^{\circ}\) into \( \sin \). This is represented as \( \sin(30^{\circ}) \).</p>
            <p>What \( \sin(30^{\circ}) \) outputs, therefore, is the ratio between two sides of a triangle, but which two sides and what triangle?</p>
            <p>Imagine that you and a friend are standing at some point on a road. There is an intersection coming up. You want to stay on the road but your friend wants to cut the corner by turning 30 degrees from the road.</p>
            <img src="sin30.gif" alt="">
            <p>In this example, \( \sin(30^{\circ}) \) is the ratio between the distance your friend skipped and the distance your friend traveled.</p>
            <p>$$\sin(30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{skipped distance}}{\text{friend's distance}}$$</p>
            <p>For ease, let's call:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the distance you traveled, adjacent (adj), since it is adjacent to the angle</li>
                <li>the distance skipped, opposite (opp), since it is opposite to the angle</li>
                <li>the distance your friend traveled, hypotenuse (hyp), for Greek reasons </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="sin30.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <p>So now we are left with $$\sin(30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}}$$ for that particular triangle.</p>
            <p>It actually doesn't matter exactly what the side lengths are, as long as the respective angle is \( 30^{\circ} \). If you went out and measured this ratio yourself, you'd find that this ratio is always \( 0.5 \).</p>

            <h3>Cosine</h3>
            <p>\( \text{cosine} \) (often abbreviated as \( \cos \)) also takes an angle as an input. It is very similar to \( \sin \); going back to the road example, \( \cos(30^{\circ}) \) is the ratio between the distance you traveled and the distance your friend traveled. $$\cos(30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{your distance}}{\text{friend's distance}}$$</p>
            <p>Going back to the adj, opp, and hyp labels from earlier, $$\cos(30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{adj}}{\text{hyp}}$$</p>
            <p>Again, measuring this ratio yourself would result in about \( 0.866 \).</p>

            <h3>Sine and Cosine Summary</h3>
            <p>This process can be done for any angle you want! There are more mathematical ways to express what \( \text{sine} \) and \( \text{cosine} \) exactly are, but they aren't relevant to this.</p>
            <p>What follows is a table showing some of the angles from 0 to 90 degrees</p>
            <table class="function">
                <tr>
                    <th>\( \theta \)</th>
                    <th>\(\sin(\theta)\)</th>
                    <th>\(\cos(\theta)\)</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>\(0^{\circ}\)</td>
                    <td>\(0\)</td>
                    <td>\(1\)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>\(15^{\circ}\)</td>
                    <td>\(0.259\)</td>
                    <td>\(0.966\)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>\(30^{\circ}\)</td>
                    <td>\(0.500\)</td>
                    <td>\(0.866\)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>\(45^{\circ}\)</td>
                    <td>\(0.707\)</td>
                    <td>\(0.707\)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>\(60^{\circ}\)</td>
                    <td>\(0.866\)</td>
                    <td>\(0.500\)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>\(75^{\circ}\)</td>
                    <td>\(0.966\)</td>
                    <td>\(0.256\)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>\(90^{\circ}\)</td>
                    <td>\(1\)</td>
                    <td>\(0\)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>The Unit Circle</h3>
            <p>The last part of trigonometry is how it relates to rotations. The link can be seen using something called the unit circle.</p>
            <p>The unit circle is simply just a circle of radius 1. That means that the distance from the center to the edge is only 1.</p>
            <p>Now, imagine a point on the circle. Because the distance from the center to the edge of the unit circle is 1, the distance from the point to the center is also 1.</p>
            <p>If we want to know some other properties about that point, we can use trigonometry! We can draw two lines for the point's \( x \) and \( y \) position. Suddenly, we have a very similar looking triangle!</p>
            <img src="unitCircle.png" alt="Unit circle">
            <p>From before, we know that $$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}}, ~\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adj}}{\text{hyp}}$$ and since we know that the hypotenuse is \( 1 \) on a unit circle, dividing by \( 1 \) does nothing and so, $$\sin(\theta) = \text{opp}, ~\cos(\theta) = \text{adj}$$</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the \(x \) coordinate of the point is exactly \( \cos(\theta) \)</li>
                <li>the \(y \) coordinate of the point is exactly \( \sin(\theta) \)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, by using \( \text{sine} \) and \( \text{cosine} \), we can always rotate a point to any angle on the unit circle!</p>
            <p>The only caveat is that the angle has to be relative to the flat \( x \) axis, since that is how we drew the triangle.</p>

            <!-- <h3>Adding 90 degrees?</h3>
            <p>Finally, we need to know what happens if we add 90 degrees to an angle. What happens to the \( \text{sine} \) and \( \text{cosine} \)? There are a few steps to consider, so pay close attention.</p>
            <p>Let's say we have some angle \( \theta \) and we want to find $$\sin(\theta + 90^{\circ}), ~ \cos(\theta + 90^{\circ})$$</p>
            <p>We can start by drawing the normal unit circle with normal \( \theta \)</p>
            <img src="unitCircle.png" alt="Unit circle">
            <p>Then we can add 90 degrees to \( \theta \) and draw that</p>
            <img src="unitCircle+90.png" alt="Unit circle">
            <p>Interestingly, this can make a new triangle, but flipped the other way!</p>
            <img src="newUnitCircle+90.png" alt="Unit circle">
            <p>Now, we need to know what that new angle in that triangle is. We can use the fact that a straight line has an "angle" of 180 degrees! So, $$180^{\circ} = ? + 90^{\circ} + \theta$$</p>
            <p>By doing algebra, subtract 90 degrees from both sides, subtract \( \theta \) from both sides, and then we are left with $$90^{\circ} - \theta = ?$$</p>
            <img src="newUnitCircle+90withmystery.png" alt="Unit circle">
            <p>We now have a new mystery angle! You may know that adding all the angles of a triangle together is also 180 degrees. We know two of those, the right angle (\( 90^{\circ} \)) and the \( 90^{\circ} - \theta\) angle, so $$180^{\circ} = 90^{\circ} + (90^{\circ} - \theta) + ?$$</p>
            <p>Start by subtracting 90 degrees, then another 90 degrees from both sides $$0 = -\theta + ?$$</p>
            <p>Then att \( \theta \) to both sides $$\theta = ?$$</p>
            <p>And so there we go! We know that this triangle actually has the original \( \theta \)!</p>
            <img src="newUnitCircleTheta.png" alt="Unit circle">
            <p>Using the very original \( \theta \) triangle from before, we know the opposite and adjacent sides</p>
