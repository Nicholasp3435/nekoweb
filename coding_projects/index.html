            <h2 class="ascii fancy rainbow">things that i code</h2>
    
            <p>As you can see, I like coding websites lol</p>
            <br>
            <p>however, I also like to code small applets with java! I've also learned C as well in school and it's growing on me tbh. Both have valid use cases</p>
            <p>One thing that I really enjoyed is a 3D model viewer! I took a <i class="fancy wavy-t">linear algebra</i>
                course where we learned about how matrices can transform vectors. We only dealt with 2D but I went out 
                and learned about how to do it in 3D (and sorta in 4D; it gets complicated kinda quickly lol). 
            </p>
            <p>maybe i could have a page for fun math things? idk how to make it super interesting other than linear algebra and 3D rendering</p>
