			<title>Piedmont NWR Birding</title>
			<description>
                Today I went birding with my uni's birding club to Piedmont National Wildlife
                Refuge! We were aiming to see some of the rare Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, and we
                can happily say that we found three of them! The pictures I got are not the best,
                but I think they're at least okay.
